All your efforts to promote your physical therapy clinic may be fruitless if your content fails to attract and retain patients. You need unique, useful and relevant content with an emotional appeal. Run-of-the-mill articles won’t do the trick – you need killer content to stand a chance.</p></div></li>					
					<li class="col-md-3 col-xs-6 pre-last"><div><img src="/wp-content/themes/cleversolution/images/img-cl/vector-smart-object-sound.png" alt=""><p>Don’t underestimate SMM. SMM is the stepchild of digital marketing. Hardly any company puts focus on quality promotion on social networks. That is a mistake. Social networking platforms help your brand communicate with customers via content and in the comments section. Build brand awareness, increase patient loyalty and the boost in conversions will follow.</p></div></li>
					<li class="col-md-3 col-xs-6"><div><img src="/wp-content/themes/cleversolution/images/img-cl/vector-smart-object-voice.png" alt=""><p>Cement your authority in the physical therapy space. People don’t want to entrust their health to a clinic no one knows about. You may have a perfect website with dozens of cool articles, but if there is no trust, it will be very hard to gain traction. Ensure that people know you well enough to recommend to their friends and colleagues.</p></div></li>
