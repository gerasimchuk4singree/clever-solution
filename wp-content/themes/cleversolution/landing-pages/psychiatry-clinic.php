                                    Keywords are an important on-page SEO factor. If your psychiatry website features incorrect keywords in page texts, blog posts, images, titles, links, etc., it will never achieve a high SERP and attract the right visitors. It is easy to explain why. Search crawlers use keywords to identify the context of your website and then calculate its index. Meanwhile, users type in those keywords in the search bar to find relevant results. Clever Solution’s SEOs are experts in selecting and implementing the correct keywords. Just contact our team and we will do what it takes to promote your mental health website.

                                    After you have selected the proper keywords, you need to add them to your website. Web page texts and blog posts are a safe bet, yet you need to incorporate keywords on a structural level too – that is, to include them in tags and meta descriptions. Our SEO team is ready for the job. We will audit your website to find tags and descriptions without keywords. We will fix them to guarantee a higher search engine ranking. Contact Clever Solution to see the difference in a way your psychiatry clinic website ranks in search engines.

                                    To reach the top your psychiatry website needs to be properly structured. It should be easy to use and navigate not only for your patients but also for search bots. Clever Solution’s designers and SEOs will work together to enhance your website from an architecture standpoint. We will adjust its design, add meta tags to every page, set up a robot.txt file, etc. Our pros guarantee that your website will rank better.

                                    To compete in the crowded mental health space, your website needs to feature a great amount of visually appealing images. They capture visitors’ attention, giving your content time to convert them into leads and patients. Having lots of properly optimized images is important from an SEO standpoint, too. Contact our team to ensure that every image is optimized and works for the sake of your clinic. We will work hard to satisfy both search crawlers and visitors.

                                    Links are what search crawlers look for when calculating a website’s SERP. Having properly optimized links is crucial to your psychiatry website, and Clever Solution pros are ready to help. We will scan your website to find ‘broken’ and low-quality links. We will also detect duplicate pages and close them from indexing in a robots.txt file. After that, our experts will optimize your website’s links: making them shorter, including keywords and improving their structure. You can count on our professionals to do the job right.

                                    The psychiatry industry is special as it deals with people who suffer from mental issues. Those people may be afraid of their problems and never face them, or they may not even be aware how their emotions influence their everyday lives. That is why your website needs to have a lot of educational content in the blog.

                                    To attract and retain patients, you need to rely on visually appealing but educational content – infographics. Information-based infographics are easily shared and quite popular because they help people solve their problems. But to create infographics which your target audience loves, you need to know your buyer personas, at what stage of the buyer’s journey they are currently on, what problems they face, etc. In other words, you need to collect and analyze lots of data to succeed. Clever Solution’s SEOs, designers and SMM professionals can help. Just contact our team and we will do it right.
