                                    Make your website’s interface and structure as simple and understandable as possible. People hate to be confused by excessive blocks of information and do not appreciate ugly-designed websites. Being visually appealing, easy to understand and use is your website’s key to success.

                                    Your clinic’s website will never make it to the top of search results, if keywords are not properly selected. Featuring incorrect short-tailed keywords in page texts, blog posts, images, titles or links may affect your search engine rankings. Our SEOs will exclude those and replace them with effective long keywords that will place your clinic’s website at the very top.
                                </p>
                                <h3>OPTIMIZATION OF TAGS AND META DESCRIPTIONS</h3>

                                    To improve your SEO performance, you need to make sure that tags and meta descriptions on your website are effectively optimized per the requirements of search engines. Your SERPs may suffer if your tags and meta descriptions do not include relevant keyword of proper length. Clever Solution will revise your website and apply necessary changes to effectively optimize your tags and meta descriptions.
                                </p>

                                    Increase navigability of your website to make both users and search crawlers love it. Reducing the number of times users have to click in order to find any information on your website guarantees better SERP performance. Our team will refine your primary care clinic website’s architecture and make it cognitively satisfying to users.
                                </p>

                                    To deliver the best rankings your website’s visual components such as photos, images, infographics and so on have to be effectively optimized as well. Visual content is crucial when it comes to digital marketing success. Resolution, size, Alt tags and titles play a vital role in search engine result rankings. Clever Solution’s SEOs know how to do the job right.
                                </p>

                                    Your website’s link profile should be perfect to meet search engine requirements. Make sure it doesn’t include ‘broken’, duplicated or low-quality long links with inefficient structure otherwise you will never achieve positive results. Our experts will conduct the analysis of your website’s link profile and work on its enhancements.
                                </p>
