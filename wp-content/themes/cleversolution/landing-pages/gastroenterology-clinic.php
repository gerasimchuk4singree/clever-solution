                                    A high conversion rate is what every website needs in order to ensure one’s business stays on the map so its importance cannot be overlooked.

                                <p class="text-justify">
                                    Setting realistic conversion goals will move you closer to reaching them.

                                <h3>UI OPTIMIZATION & CUSTOMER CONVERSION</h3>
                                <p class="text-justify">
                                    In order to encourage visitors to use your website and convert, your gastroenterology clinic's website has to speak their language – your website has to feel and look right, so make sure it is easy to navigate and understand. Huge information blocks and complex structure usually scare potential clients away. Clever Solution knows how to trigger your users to convert on your website, not on your competitor’s.
                                </p>
                                <h3>TRAFFIC ANALYSIS</h3>
                                <p class="last-cl text-justify">
                                    Incoming traffic gives you access to information about your prospect and patient location, so that you can take advantage of it to find out where to directly reach your target audience and drive more traffic to your clinic’s website. Our SEOs will analyze all the sources of incoming traffic, sort out the most effective ones and double down on efforts to bring value to your gastroenterology clinic’s website.

                                <p class="text-justify">
                                    Every website wants to rank high for the right keyword and it is getting harder each day. Short-tail keywords don’t cut it,  it is often hard to find the right long-tail keywords. But our SEO experts know how to make it work. They will do the research, select and implement effective long-tail keywords, so that users can type relevant keywords into the search bar and see your website at the top of the results.
                                </p>
                                <h3>OPTIMIZATION OF TAGS AND META DESCRIPTIONS</h3>
                                <p class="text-justify">
                                    On-page factor optimization requires an integrated approach and cannot yield fruit without properly optimized tags and meta descriptions. If your website’s tags and meta descriptions do not feature relevant keywords and phrases, do not expect it to reach search excellence. Clever Solution experts will check the quality of tags and meta descriptions and make amendments if needed.
                                </p>
                                <h3>SITE ARCHITECTURE ANALYSIS AND OPTIMIZATION</h3>
                                <p class="text-justify">
                                    Visually appealing and easy to understand websites ensure better conversions compared to those with complex structure and unattractive design. People will buy from you and use your services only if they love the way your website looks and when it appears on the first page of search engine results. Rarely do users go past the first page results. Strong site architecture greatly contributes to both of these. You can trust us to do the job right.
                                </p>
                                <h3>IMAGE OPTIMIZATION</h3>
                                <p class="text-justify">
                                    High-quality visual content is a part and a parcel of each website. If you have it, then make sure that it is meets search engine requirements and satisfies search crawlers. All the photos, images, infographics and pictures have to feature relevant Alt tags, be of high resolution, meet the standards of shape and size. If not, our SEOs will take care of this and improve your SERPs.
                                </p>
                                <h3>URL/LINK OPTIMIZATION</h3>
                                <p>
                                    Another important factor which can easily down-rank your gastroenterology clinic website is not properly optimized link profile. Your website has to be effectively interlinked, exclude broken links and duplicates to deliver the best search rankings and listings. Our experts will implement a full website audit, find out and fix possible shortcomings.
                                </p>
