                    Without clear functionality of the website, no matter how pretty the design is, it is useless. We are not saying that either element is less important, but that the design of the website is only half the job. The development stage includes a number of components, and depending on the needs of your businesses, we find a fitting solution, as well as guide and consult you throughout on the basis of our extensive experience. Be it a web app, mobile app, or both (as is the case today with growing number of mobile devices out there), we develop an application which is clear and easy to navigate, provides option for the consumer to communicate with the business by providing feedback, and of course, certain extent of personalization.

                        We offer a range of development solutions for our clients, with an individual approach to each challenge we are presented with. If you have questions regarding your allocated budget for the development of the website, there is a possibility of doing a more standard website development.

                        Having an awesome website, which looks and works like a dream is wonderful, but unfortunately, it isn’t enough. Considering that there are well over a billion websites out there, covering everything and anything, standing out becomes quite a bit of a challenge. That is why digital marketing is essential, as it brings you and your potential customers together. What every business should remember, is that it’s not only you looking for the customer, but that said customer is looking for you too.

                        Businesses today have to be very conscious as to how their web presence overall, not just their website, impacts their business and profitability. What we do is bring both you and your potential customer together through a number of tools.

                        Marketing via the internet differs greatly from traditional methods of marketing, as it is in many ways more subtle. Today’s customers are more informed than ever before, and they get that information from the internet. A digital presence for a business today is just as essential for its survival as air is for us.

                        What Clever Solution does is put you on the map in the internet, attract to you your consumers, engage them, convert them to become your customer, and keep them coming back to you. Engaging the customers is probably the hardest bit, since today’s internet users have learned to ignore much of advertising and look specifically for content that is valuable particularly to them. We can’t go spilling our secrets at how we do it, but we will tell you this - we have a proven track record of reducing the bounce rate of visitors to our clients’ websites, which leads to an increased customer base and increased profits for you.

                                        What many people forget, is how the success of the business online depends on a number of elements, not just how it is marketed. Three elements are integral in attracting, converting and retaining the customer online, and they are:
                                        <ul class="ul-tire">
                                            <li>design of the website,</li>
                                            <li>functionality of the interface, and</li>
                                            <li>marketing of the business (web app) digitally.</li>

                                        Therefore, in our Clever Integrated Solutions section, we offer to integrate all 3 elements - resulting in designing, developing and marketing online your business. What you get is a turnkey project handed over to you, easy to use and maintain.

                                        <li>Drafting and planning is done at this stage, where we create a mock up of the website on the basis of the information you have provided us with in the first step. A mock up of a website is in a way its map and its base, upon which the design and development stages will take place.</li>
                                        <li>The design stage, where we create a custom graphic design of a web or mobile application for you, which complements your brand and is attractive to the customer as well.

                                        <li>Development is when the design is made functional. Functionality of the website is one of the most important attributes to a successful web application, and successful digital marketing processes too. Before the website is delivered and hosted online, it is thoroughly tested by our team.</li>
                                        <li>After the finished web application has been launched online, the digital marketing phase begins. Here, the website is constantly updated with new information, marketed online and search engine optimized, among other things. In this phase, analysis of the business performance online is continuously done, and strategy, which was earlier developed to digitally market the business is adjusted where needed, when needed. You are constantly updated on the progress and work done at this stage as well.</li>
                                        <li>This last step is optional, as it involves further maintenance and development of application per your request.</li>
